Currently, the app allows users to create a basic account, login, view a feed with one post from each other user without any sort of priority sorting algorithm and view, edit and delete their own posts. They can also view a user page for other users by clicking the author name of other users in their feed. This user page has a feed of all of the displayed users posts. Users can log out. All but the create account and log in pages are restricted to logged in users and users are automatically redirected to a gatekeeper page informing them of this until they are logged in. Users can like and dislike posts by other users but not ones posted by themselves. Users can choose to watch other users and can be watched by other users. Users can also stop watching users. A page displays all users that aren't already being watched by the current user. Posts can be edited and are still run through the same validations as new posts to ensure there are no links or pictures embedded in them. Users can also view each others home pages that list all posts a user has made in order of newest to oldest. Users can upload one profile picture. The old one is deleted when a new one is uploaded. Users can add up to ten users to a "short list" that appears on their homepage. 

I am working to create an algorithm for which posts are given priority. My goal is to make posts from people the user knows appear first, then posts from people that follow the user but that the user doesn't follow, then finally posts from users the current user isn't associated with in any way. I'd also like to add a similar algorithm for the look around page that displays new users to check out. Additionally, I'd like to make it so a user can only like or dislike a post once and if they've liked or disliked the post, the buttons disappear.
