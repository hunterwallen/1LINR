Currently, the app allows users to create a basic account, login, view a feed with one post from each other user without any sort of priority sorting algorithm and view, edit and delete their own posts. They can also view a user page for other users by clicking the author name of other users in their feed. This user page has a feed of all of the displayed users posts. Users can log out. All but the create account and log in pages are restricted to logged in users and users are automatically redirected to a gatekeeper page informing them of this until they are logged in.

In the future I will be adding like/dislike button functionality. I will also be adding the ability to upload a profile photo, plenty of styling, a way to edit your profile info after it's created, a way to follow users and be followed by users that will display you following users content first in your feed. Infinite scroll is another feature I plan to add to the feed to prevent having to load too much content at one time. I will be adding a new people to watch page that will display all users that are not already being followed by you. Eventually, adding search by location and name functionality to this page is also important.
